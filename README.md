# Crime analysis

## Project Overview
Iâ€™m using a [large dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nihandincer/data-analysis-of-boston-crimes/input ) with over 300k rows and 17 columns containing crimes that occurred in Boston between 2015 and 2018. I use the numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to read, explore and respond to some questions at the end of the notebook, using charts and heatmaps. 

The notebook can be found here: [data-exploration-m.ipynb](https://github.com/miubogdan/crime-analysis/blob/main/data-exploration-m.ipynb)
